My name is Chenguang Li. I am from China Henan Province. I studied at Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine Department of Anatomy for about six years. I'm writing a graduation thesis about "Morphological and functional abnormalities of hippocampus in APC1638T/1638T mice". I like playing basketball when I have time and that gives me alot of chances to learn about how important teamwork is. I have been playing basketball for over 9 years since senior high school. I also worked as an hourly worker in a Japanese restaurant for five years. During this period, I met guests from different countries and was able to communicate with them smoothly to provide catering services.
